# a* pathfinding maze editor
Pathfinding project focused on maze navigation using A* algorithm. It has been modified so that it is only allowed to go straight or turn right. The project includes a Python implementation that restricts the movement capabilities.

Additionally, the repository features a custom maze editor built with Python's Tkinter library. The editor enables users to design and create their own mazes, providing a graphical interface for maze customization. The custom mazes can be solved by clicking the solve button. Try it out by running maze_editor.py!

By running maze_pathfinding.py you can see the paths for a couple of self made mazes.
